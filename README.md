# hello-world
my first repository - no clue what I'm doing yet 

I'm new to the coding world and excited to learn all that I can
I was recently admitted to a coding bootcamp that begins in September! So I have some time to work on new projects every day!
I know that I'm not anyone special and don't expect a miracle - I want to put in the work. Part of my struggles, though, is that it's easy to get distracted with all of the resources that exist! That's why I joined a coding bootcamp so I can get the structure I want.
